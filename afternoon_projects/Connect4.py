# # Connect4
# Board Representation:

# Think about how you want to represent the Connect Four board. You could use a list of lists or a 2D array.
# Displaying the Board:

# Write a function to display the current state of the board. This could be a simple text-based representation.
# Player Input:

# Implement a function to get input from players. Make sure to validate the input (e.g., ensure the column is not full, accept only valid column numbers).
# Making Moves:

# Write a function to update the board based on the player's move.
# Check for a Win:

# Implement a function to check if a player has won the game. This involves checking for four consecutive discs in a row, column, or diagonal.
# Switching Players:

# Write a mechanism to switch between players after each move.
# Main Game Loop:

# Create a loop to keep the game running until there's a winner or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
# End of Game:

# Display the winner or announce a draw at the end of the game.
